<h1> Evaluating Support for Cannabis Legalization: 2020 Referendum Analysis </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>

This project analyzes data from the 2020 Cannabis Referendum in New Zealand to help the Green Party determine if it is worth pursuing a citizen-initiated referendum in the next election cycle. The analysis focuses on two main questions:
A cannabis referendum is a public vote where people decide whether cannabis (marijuana) should be legalized or not.

In the 2020 New Zealand Cannabis Referendum, voters were asked if they supported the proposed Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill, which would make recreational cannabis legal under specific rules. People voted either "Yes" (to legalize) or "No" (to keep it illegal).

<b> Refrendum: </b> The referendum was a way for the government to understand public opinion on the issue and decide whether to change the law based on the results.

<b> The Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill:</b> This Bill was proposed in New Zealand to legalize and regulate recreational cannabis use. In the 2020 referendum, 50.7% of voters opposed the bill, resulting in its rejection. Consequently, recreational cannabis remains illegal in New Zealand. However, medicinal cannabis is legal under the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Act 2018, allowing access for patients with specific medical conditions. 

   
#### Objectives
1. Identify the proportion of support for cannabis legalization within the sample.
2. Analyze demographic trends (age, gender, etc.) to understand who supported legalization.
3. Address missing data using basic imputation techniques, as a considerable amount of data was missing, especially from younger respondents.
